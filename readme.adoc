This is the _artifact repository_ for bower containing the Javascript client of http://http://www.open-dolphin.org[OpenDolphin]

= Usage

For playground projects invoke `bower install open-dolphin-js`.
Otherwise we recommend to use a `bower.json` file for the configuration of this dependency.
Here is a minimal example:

.bower.json
[source,javascript]
----
{
    "name":  "myclientapp",
    "version": "0.0.1",
    "dependencies": {
        "open-dolphin-js": "1.0-RC2B3"
    }
}
----

Then invoke `bower install`

Both install commands will produce a new folder `bower_components` with a subfolder `open-dolphin-js`.
In your html file you can use it like this:

[source,html]
----
<script type="text/javascript" src="bower_components/open-dolphin-js/dist/opendolphin.js"></script>
...

var dolphin = opendolphin.makeDolphin().url(odConfig.DOLPHIN_URL).reset(true).supportCORS(true).build();
----

Also make sure that you enable the CORS support when you initialize dolphin as shown in the example.
This is necessary since when you work with bower you most likely
either load your html and `opendolphin.js` from the local filesystem during development
or from a different webapplication (containing just the client) than your server webapp.

= Additional Remarks

My (Sven Ehrke) preferred way to use `opendolphin.js` is by using it's webjar version and not through bower.
That way you can integrate it into your maven or gradle build system which you probably have anyway on the
server side.
But there might be situations for which it is better to work with the bower module.
The ones which I can currently think of are:

* Client and Server teams are separated from each other and it is not possible to get `opendolphin.js` from the server.
* The Client Team's build system is based upon javascript tools and the team prefers to use this toolchain to get access to `opendolphin.js`

= Information for Maintainers

Users of this bower module can ignore this section which is intended for the maintainers of this bower module.

== Initial registration

[NOTE]
Needs to be done only once or in the unlikely case someone messes up the registration.

* register opendolphin.js as bower component :
**`bower register open-dolphin-js git://github.com/canoo/open-dolphin-js-bower-repo.git`
** check: `bower info open-dolphin-js`

= Make a new release

* change version in `bower.json`
* git tag -a "1.0-RC2B3" -m "version 1.0-RC2B3"
* git push --tags
